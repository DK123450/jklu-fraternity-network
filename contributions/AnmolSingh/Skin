Lead was a common additive they used to put into gasoline to avoid spontaneous combustion when the fuel is put under pressure. Repeated exposition to high concentrations of lead produce permanent IQ loss and mood changes. My theory is that GoT dragons use some sort of fuel or hydrocarbon they naturally produce (magic creatures), and they add lead into it, maybe by ingesting it from an external source, to avoid the fuel exploding inside them when they pump it out and ignite it to burn some guy.

My theory is that all the people who we see in the show, 
who apparently become idiots due to bad and lazy writing, are actually getting their IQs constantly and progressively lowered by the fumes from the dragonfire. 
Cersei, who has never been in contact with a dragon, has been in contact with the fumes from valyrian fire, 
which probably has lead in it, so she become dumber in the battle in the river, and dumber when she burnt the church. Finally, 
they all are poisoned again in the final battle of King's landing (a lot of dragonfire there), originating the dumbest scene, at the end of the series, when they all talk and choose king. But it's not bad writing. 
They are just a lot of sick people from an era without any actual medical knowledge.
