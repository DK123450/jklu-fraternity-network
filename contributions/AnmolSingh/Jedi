[Star Wars] Anakin Died

Let me start out by saying I have no proof of this whatsoever and have no concrete backing to this theory.

Anakin Skywalker is actually a clone of the original. Why I believe this? Well podracing. Whenever I think about it, a boy as young as Anakin having skills racing/building a podracer is absolutely insane. I know you probably will chalk it up to as "Oh he's just naturally talented because the force, midichlorians, etc" but I say maybe you're right.

OR maybe he got those skills from the original that died? A Sith maybe? Shmi claimed that there was no father.
So perhaps while she was a slave, an old dying Anakin Jedi Mind Tricked her so he could implant a clone of himself inside her womb so he could carry on his legacy.
Either that or he had such a knowledge of the force that he could influence mediclorians to make a child in her without Shmi knowing about it.
